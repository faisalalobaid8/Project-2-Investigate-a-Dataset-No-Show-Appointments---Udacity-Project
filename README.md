# Project 2 Investigate a Dataset No Show Appointments - Udacity Project

Data Set: No-show appointments dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil kaggle which could be found here and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment

‘ScheduledDay’ tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment.
‘Neighborhood’ indicates the location of the hospital.
‘Scholarship’ indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program.
‘No-show’ says ‘No’ if the patient showed up to their appointment, and ‘Yes’ if they did not show up.
